     _C_a_r maintains a CP/M compatible file system using a syntax
     similar to _a_r(1).

     _K_e_y is one character from the set ddrrttxx,, optionally con-
     catenated with one or more of vvccaa.. _D_e_v_i_c_e is the file or
     device for the CP/M file system, which will be created if
     necessary after a yy response to the query.  The meanings of
     the _k_e_y characters are:

     dd    Delete all named files from the device, or all files on
          device if no specific files are named.  Deletion of all
          files is queried before being obeyed.

     rr    Replace the named files on the device.

     tt    Print a table of contents of the device.  When used
          with vv will also give some statistics, assuming an 8"
          single sided, single density IBM format diskette.

     xx    Extract the named files.  If no names are given, all
          files in the archive are extracted.  In neither case
          does xx alter the contents of the device.

     vv    Verbose.  Under the verbose option, _c_a_r gives a file-
          by-file description of what it is doing.  When used
          with tt,, it gives a long listing of all information
          about the files, and some space statistics.

     cc    Clobber the device.  All files are deleted before any
          other operation is commenced.  This command is queried
          before being obeyed.

     aa    Use "ascii" mode.  In option rr carriage returns are
          inserted before newlines on the copy.  In option xx new-
          lines are deleted, carriage returns are replaced by
          newlines, and the CP/M end-of-file marker (control-z)
          is heeded.

BBUUGGSS
     Won't handle double sided or double density diskette for-
     mats.  Files cannot be replaced onto the device in any other
     user area than user zero.  * CP/M is a trademark of Digital
